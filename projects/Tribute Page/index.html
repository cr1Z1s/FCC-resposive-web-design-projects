          Jadav Payeng covers the distance from the island banks to his forest
          on his bicycle, carrying the supplies he uses while working on his
          forest and abundant vegetable farm.

          The place lies in Jorhat, some 350 km from Guwahati by road, and it
          wasn’t easy for Sunday Times to access him. At one point on the
          stretch, a smaller road has to be taken for some 30 km to reach the
          riverbank. There, if one is lucky, boatmen will ferry you across to
          the north bank. A trek of another 7 km will then land you near
          Payeng’s door. Locals call the place ‘Molai Kathoni’ (Molai’s woods)
          after Payeng’s pet name, Molai. <br /><br />It all started way back in
          1979 when floods washed a large number of snakes ashore on the
          sandbar. One day, after the waters had receded, Payeng , only 16 then,
          found the place dotted with the dead reptiles. That was the turning
          point of his life. <br /><br />“The snakes died in the heat, without
          any tree cover. I sat down and wept over their lifeless forms. It was
          carnage . I alerted the forest department and asked them if they could
          grow trees there. They said nothing would grow there. Instead, they
          asked me to try growing bamboo. It was painful, but I did it. There
          was nobody to help me. Nobody was interested,” says Payeng, now 47.
          <br /><br />Leaving his education and home, he started living on the
          sandbar. Unlike Robinson Crusoe, Payeng willingly accepted a life of
          isolation. And no, he had no Man Friday. He watered the plants morning
          and evening and pruned them. After a few years, the sandbar was
          transformed into a bamboo thicket. “I then decided to grow proper
          trees. I collected and planted them. I also transported red ants from
          my village, and was stung many times. Red ants change the soil’s
          properties . That was an experience,” Payeng says, laughing.
          <br /><br />Soon, there were a variety of flora and fauna which burst
          in the sandbar, including endangered animals like the one-horned rhino
          and Royal Bengal tiger. “After 12 years, we’ve seen vultures.
          Migratory birds, too, have started flocking here. Deer and cattle have
          attracted predators,” claims Payeng . He says locals recently killed a
          rhino which was seen in his forest at another forest in Sibsagar
          district. <br /><br />Payeng talks like a trained conservationist.
          “Nature has made a food chain; why can’t we stick to it? Who would
          protect these animals if we, as superior beings, start hunting them?”
          <br /><br />The Assam state forest department learnt about Payeng’s
          forest only in 2008 when a herd of some 100 wild elephants strayed
          into it after a marauding spree in villages nearby. They also
          destroyed Payeng’s hutment . It was then that assistant conservator of
          forests Gunin Saikia met Payeng for the first time. <br /><br />“We
          were surprised to find such a dense forest on the sandbar. Locals,
          whose homes had been destroyed by the pachyderms, wanted to cut down
          the forest, but Payeng dared them to kill him instead. He treats the
          trees and animals like his own children. Seeing this, we, too, decided
          to pitch in,” says Saikia. “We’re amazed at Payeng. He has been at it
          for 30 years. Had he been in any other country, he would have been
          made a hero.”
