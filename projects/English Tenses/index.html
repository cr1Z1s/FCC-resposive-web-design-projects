    <h3>introduction</h3>
    <p>The present simple is also called simple present or present tense. We use it to talk about present actions and
      events that take place repeatedly or one after the other, facts, and future actions that are determined by a
      timetable or schedule. It is one of the most commonly used tenses in the English language.</p>
    <h3>example</h3>
    <div class="example">
      <p>Colin likes football. He is a forward. A forward tries to score goals for his team.</p>
      <p>Colin plays football every Tuesday. His training starts at five o’clock. After school Colin goes home, packs
        his bag, puts on his football shirt and then he goes to football training. He has to take the bus. The bus
        leaves at half past four.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>usage</h3>
    <p>We use the simple present tense for:</p>
    <ul class="use-case">
      <li>events that take place regularly or habitually with signal words such as: always, never, rarely, often
      </li>
      <code>Example:
He plays football every Tuesday.</code>
      <li>events that take place one after the other</li>
      <code>Example:
After school Colin goes home, packs his bag, puts on his football shirt and then he goes to football training.</code>
      <li>
        facts, or things that are generally valid
      </li>

A forward tries to score goals for his team.</code>
      <li>
        future actions that are planned and predetermined (e.g. by a timetable or programme)</li>

    <header>present progressive</header>
    <h3>introduction</h3>
    <p>The present progressive, also known as the present continuous tense, is formed with the verb be and the present
      participle or -ing form of the main verb. We use this tense to talk about actions that are in progress at the
      time of speaking and temporary actions. We can also use the present progressive to talk about future arrangements
      and plans.</p>
    <h3>example</h3>
    <div class="example">
      <p>James is travelling around Australia. He is staying at a youth hostel in a little Australian town. The town is
        becoming more and more popular because of its beautiful beaches.</p>
      <p>James is meeting his friend Brad in town tonight. Brad is working there as a tour guide over the summer.</p>
      <p>James is in the town centre now. Look! James is taking a picture of another tourist.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>usage</h3>
    <p>We use the simple present tense for:</p>
    <ul class="use-case">
      <li>actions that are taking place at the present moment i.e. now</li>
      <code>Example: Look! James is taking a picture of another tourist.</code>
      <li>predetermined plans or appointments that have been made for the near future</li>
      <code>Example:
He is meeting his friend Brad tonight.</code>
      <li>actions that are only happening temporarily</li>
      <code>Example:
James is travelling around Australia.
<br>Brad is working there as a tour guide over the summer.</code>
      <li>actions that are currently happening, but not at this very moment</li>
      <code>Example:
He is staying at a youth hostel.</code>
      <li>situations that are changing</li>
      <code>Example:
The town is becoming more and more popular because of its beautiful beaches.</code>
    </ul>
    <h3>signal words</h3>
    <p>Signal words can help us to recognise the tense in a sentence. The signal words for the present progressive are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>at the moment</li>
      <li>now, just now, right now</li>
      <li>Listen!</li>
      <li>Look!</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="present_perfect">
    <header>present perfect</header>
    <h3>introduction</h3>
    <p>The present perfect tense connects the past with the present. Use this tense to emphasise the result of a past
      action, especially when the exact time of this action is not important. The present perfect is formed using a
      present form of the verb have and the past participle of the main verb. Be aware that many languages have a tense
      that is similar to the present perfect, however, the usage is probably different.</p>
    <h3>example</h3>
    <div class="example">
      <p>James loves football and plays very well. He has bought new trainers and now he plays even better than before.</p>
      <p>James is the team captain because he has never lost a match.</p>
      <p>It looks like his team will win this match as well. James has just scored a goal and the referee has not blown
        the final whistle yet. The other team has not scored a goal so far.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>usage</h3>
    <p>We use the present perfect tense to express:</p>
    <ul class="use-case">
      <li>an action that has just been completed</li>
      <code>Example: He has just scored a goal.</code>
      <li>a completed action with influence on the present</li>
      <code>Example: He has bought new trainers and now he plays even better than before.</code>
      <li>an action that has never happened, or has happened once or several times up to the time of speaking</li>
      <code>Example:
      He has never lost a match.</code>
    </ul>
    <h3>signal words</h3>
    <p>Signal words can help us to recognise the tense in a sentence. The signal words for the present perfect are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>already, just, not yet</li>
      <li>ever, never</li>
      <li>so far, till now, up to now</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="present_perfect_progressive">
    <header>present perfect progressive</header>
    <h3>introduction</h3>
    <p>The present perfect progressive tense, also present perfect continuous, expresses an action that begins in the
      past and lasts until a present or almost present moment. The timing of this action is not specified, instead, the
      result or process of the action is emphasised. The present perfect progressive is conjugated with the present
      form of have, the past participle of be and the present participle or -ing form of the main verb.</p>
    <h3>example</h3>
    <div class="example">
      <p>Aaron has been repairing cars since he was sixteen years old. He has always wanted to be a mechanic.</p>
      <p>He has been working in this garage for ten years.</p>
      <p>As Aaron has been changing tyres all morning, his clothes are dirty now.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>usage</h3>
    <p>The present perfect progressive is similar to the present perfect, but we use it to express a continuing  class="use-case"or unfished action, or emphasise the duration of an action. Here are the three main uses of the present perfect continuous:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>emphasise the duration, and not the result, of an action</li>
      <code>Example: Aaron has been repairing cars since he was sixteen years old.</code>
      <li>express an action lasting from a point in the past until now, and possibly into the future (Since when?/How long?)</li>
      <code>Example: He has been working in this garage for ten years.</code>
      <li>express completed actions with influence on the present</li>
      <code>Example:
        As he has been changing tyres all morning, his clothes are dirty now. (influence on the present: his clothes are dirty now)</code>
    </ul>
    <h3>signal words</h3>
    <p>Signal words can help us to recognise the tense in a sentence. The signal words for the present perfect progressive are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>all day, the whole week</li>
      <li>for 4 years, since 1993, how long?</li>
      <li>lately</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="past_simple">
    <header>past simple</header>
    <h3>introduction</h3>
    <p>The past simple tense, also known as the past simple, the past tense or the preterite, expresses completed actions in the recent and distant past. It is the basic past tense in English grammar. We form this tense with the past simple form of the main verb and the auxiliary verb do. The duration of an action is not important in the simple past, instead, we exmphasise when an action took place.</p>
    <h3>example</h3>
    <div class="example">
      <p>Last month a girl from China joined our class. She came in, introduced herself, and began to talk about her country. She showed us where she was from on a map. While she was talking about her home town, the school bell suddenly rang.</p>
      <p>If I spoke Chinese, I would love to go on a holiday to China.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>usage</h3>
    <p>The simple past is the basic form of the past tense in English grammar, we use it for:</p>
    <ul class="use-case">
      <li>actions that happened once or repeatedly in the past</li>
      <code>Example: Last month a girl from China joined our class.</code>
      <li>actions that happened one after the other in the past</li>
      <code>Example: She came in, introduced herself, and began to talk about her country.</code>
      <li>a new action interrupting an action that was already taking place, together with the past progressive tense</li>
      <code>Example: While she was talking about her home town, the school bell suddenly rang.</code>
      <li>in the second conditional</li>
      <code>Example: If I spoke Chinese, I would like to go on holiday to China.</code>
    </ul>
    <h3>signal words</h3>
    <p>The simple past is used to say when something happened, so it is common to use it with expressions of time and adverbs of frequency.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Time expressions: yesterday, 2 minutes ago, in 1990, the other day, last Friday etc.</li>
      <li>Adverbs of frequency: always, often, sometimes, rarely, never etc.</li>
      <li>2nd/unreal conditional</li>
    </ul>

      <header>past progressive</header>
      <h3>introduction</h3>
      <p>The past progressive tense, also called the past continuous tense, emphasises a continuing or incomplete action in the past. We can use this tense to describe what was in progress at a specific moment in time in the past. It is formed with the auxiliary verb be, conjugated in the past (was/were), and present participle or -ing form of the main verb.</p>
      <h3>example</h3>
      <div class="example">
        <p>Lucy was sitting on the beach at six o’clock yesterday.</p>
        <p>Her friend Laurence doesn’t like being lazy. So while Lucy was relaxing on the beach, he was sailing.</p> 
        <p>Lucy was watching the sunset when Laurence passed by on his boat.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>usage</h3>
      <p>There are a few ways to use the past progressive tense in English grammar. We can use it to express:</ class="use-case"p>
      <ul>
        <li>an action that was in progress at a specific time in the past</li>
        <code>Example: Lucy was sitting on the beach at six o’clock yesterday.</code>
        <li>two actions that were taking place at the same time</li>
        <code>Example: While Lucy was relaxing on the beach, Laurence was sailing.</code>
        <li>a past action that was interrupted by a second past action</li>
        <code>Example: Lucy was watching the sunset when Laurence passed by on his boat.</code>

      <h3>example</h3>

        <p>Little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet after she had made herself some porridge.</p>
        <p>She had not eaten much of her porridge when a spider frightened her away.</p> 
        <p>If the spider had not frightened her, she would have finished her porridge sitting on her tuffet.</p>
      </div>
      <h3>usage</h3>
      <p>The past perfect tense is common in written English and storytelling. We use it together with the simp class="use-case"le to express:</p>
      <ul>

      <h3>example</h3>
      <div class="example">
        <p>I went to visit Louise the other day. She had been practising the flute for hours when I arrived.</p>
        <p>Louise looked very tired because she had been practising for so long.</p>
